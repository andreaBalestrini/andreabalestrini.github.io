							<h2>Amateur Radio</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The amateur radio environment is a very interesting and stimulating environment. An amateur radio operator (OM) is a
							person who not only wants to speak on the radio,&nbsp;but also actively participates in experimentation within the
							telecommunications world.
							Experimentation,&nbsp;desire for novelty and desire to get involved are the characteristics that lead an OM to enter the
							world of radio.<br>
							The amateur radio license also attests a good knowledge of the functioning of a transceiver and the bases of the
							world of radio communication.

							<h3>My radio experience</h3>
							<p>It was 2016 when I decided to take the amateur radio license,&nbsp;I was looking for a way to communicate away
								from the modern frenzy and that would allow me to put my knowledge of electronics to good use.<br/>
								After a few years I think it was a good idea,&nbsp;even with a modest power of 50W,&nbsp;I managed to make
								connections throughout the northwest of Italy and I met other OM with which to share my passion.
